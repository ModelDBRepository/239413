# A name or title to describe the published resource.
title: "Network simulations of interneuron circuits in the honeybee primary auditory center"

# Any additional information. It is best practice to supply a description for the resource 
description: |
  This repository contains code used to simulate DL-Int-1 and DL-Int-2 neurons as part of a network
  in the honeybee primary auditory center. The implementation uses the simulator Brian 
  version 2.0.1 (RRID:SCR_002998) in Python.
